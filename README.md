# IGARSS22

This work is concerned with comparative experiments on SimCLR models and equivalent ResNet models trained with SGD loss, on FAIR1M and DOTA - remote sensing datasets.

Experimental Flow:
 - Use notebooks in my repos on overhead datasets to get your data formatted for classification
 - Run Data_Prep.ipynb
 - Train your models on each of the datasets for SimCLR and ResNet
 - Run Final_Result.ipynb in order to get your final experimental results

Note: These notebooks contain absolute paths within my google drive - you will have to adjust yours to line up with where your data/experiments are located.
